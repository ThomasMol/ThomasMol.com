### What is the Smart Nudging Engine?

As part of my Master's thesis in Business Informatics, I conducted research on designing a Smart Nudging Engine. This engine is a tool designed to create and optimize effective nudges. You can find and use the tool [here](https://smart-nudging-engine.vercel.app/).

### My Contributions

In the course of this project, I've undertaken several tasks:

- **Literature Review:** I've conducted extensive literature research on topics including (digital) nudging, smart nudging, user profiles, and recommender systems. This served to ground the project in existing knowledge and recent advancements in the field.
- **Tool Design:** Based on insights gleaned from the literature review, I designed a blueprint for the Nudging Engine.
- **Validation:** To validate the design of the Nudging Engine, I conducted interviews with industry experts and incorporated their feedback into the final design.
- **Tool Development:** Using SvelteKit for the frontend, Prisma as the ORM, and PostgreSQL for the database, I built the Nudging Engine in line with the validated design.
- **Thesis Report:** I documented the entire research process, including the tool's design and implementation, in a comprehensive thesis report. The report offers a detailed account of the research methodology, findings, and the challenges encountered during the project.

### About the Nudging Engine

The Smart Nudging Engine is an innovative tool that applies principles from behavioral science to influence user behavior in a desired direction, a technique often referred to as "nudging." The engine leverages digital nudging strategies, making it an effective tool for applications ranging from health apps promoting better lifestyle choices, e-commerce platforms influencing buying decisions, to educational tools encouraging learning behaviors.
