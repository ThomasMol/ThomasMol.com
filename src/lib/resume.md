## Experience

### Freelance software engineer

### Co-founder

**@Bizzfit** - (Feb 2021 - May 2023)

- Co-founder, in charge of developing the mobile app, marketing website, and overal product development. Bizzfit is a b2b fitness app that uses gamification elements to improve the overall health of employees and increases the chemistry of colleagues. Website can be found at [https://bizzfit.app](https://bizzfit.app)
- Developed the **[iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bizzfit/id1661301229)** and [**Android**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bizzfit.android.app) app using **Flutter** and **Supabase**
- Graduated in the Student Validation Program of UtrechtInc (Utrecht based Startup incubator [https://utrechtinc.nl](https://utrechtinc.nl))
- Ultimately failed due to time constraints (all 3 co-founders were also still students trying to graduate our master’s), and launching too late. After validating our idea with a simple [Concierge MVP](https://www.shortform.com/blog/concierge-mvp/) (it was a google form) we spent too much time building the app and not launching. This lead to not measuring and learning from users.

### **Founder**

- Built a webapp to easily generate transcripts and summaries of audio or video recordings using AI. More at [https://audiogest.app](https://audiogest.app)

- Built a novel AI pipeline to generate accurate transcripts with speaker diarization in **Python** with **whisper** and **pyannote**. Hosting the pipeline on **Replicate**. Using the GPT-4 API of OpenAI for the summarizations.
- **$1.3k+** in revenue, **35+** paying customers, **500+** transcripts generated
